\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Recent developments in Bayesian experimental pragmatics have received much attention, as it provides us with a quantitative model formalizing core concepts in traditional pragmatic theories and the predictions it makes fit empirical data nicely. Despite its theoretical advantage and empirical success, there are still several conceptual issues in the Bayesian Rational Speech Act (RSA) model that need further clarification. In this paper, we analyze a few design choices made in RSA that have intuitively equally plausible alternatives motivated from related game-theoretic approaches to pragmatics, and compare the original RSA model with these alternatives to empirical data. The result suggests that while RSA is better than most other variations, there is still room for improvement.
