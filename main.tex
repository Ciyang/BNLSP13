\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Recent developments in Bayesian experimental pragmatics have
  received much attention. The Rational Speech Act (RSA) model
  formalizes core concepts of traditional pragmatic theories
  quantitatively and makes predictions that fit empirical data
  nicely. In this paper, we analyze the RSA model and its relation to
  closely related game theoretic approaches, by spelling out its
  \emph{belief}, \emph{goal} and \emph{action} components. We
  introduce some alternatives motivated from the game theoretic
  tradition and compare models incorporating these alternatives
  systematically to the original RSA model, using Bayesian model
  comparison, in terms of their ability to predict relevant empirical
  data. The result suggests that the RSA model could be adapted and
  extended to improve its predictive power, in particular by taking
  speaker preferences into account.
