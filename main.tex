\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Recent developments in Bayesian experimental pragmatics have received much attention. The Rational Speech Act (RSA) model formalizes core concepts in traditional pragmatic theories quantitatively and makes predictions that fit empirical data nicely. In this paper, we analyze the RSA model and its relation to the closely related game-theoretic approaches to pragmatics, by spelling out its \emph{belief}, \emph{goal} and \emph{action} components. We introduce some alternatives motivated from the game-theoretic models and compare them with the RSA model to new experimental data. The result suggests that the RSA model could be adapted and extended to improve its predictive power.
