We use a Bayesian approach to model comparison
\cite{Jeffreys1961:Theory-of-Proba,KassRaftery1995:Bayes-Factors,Jaynes2003:Probability-The,VandekerckhoveMatzke2013:Model-Compariso}
to find out which alternative best explains the observed data. The
models under investigation have unspecified parameters: the speaker's
degree of of rationality $\lambda_\mathrm{S}$, the cost of adjectives
$c$, and, for those listener models that have an action-oriented
communication goal, the listener's degree of rationality
$\lambda_\mathrm{L}$. Since there is no principled theory to determine
the value of the parameters, we will rely mostly on relatively
uninformed hyperpriors (so-called to distinguish them from the
salience priors). Based on a specification of hyperpriors, we
calculate the models' \emph{evidences} and compare them by their
\emph{Bayes factors}. The evidence of a model $M$ is the weighted
average of the likelihood of observing the data under all parameter
values:
\begin{align}
  \label{BMA}
  \mathrm{Ev}(M)= \int \Pr(\theta) \cdot \Pr(D  \mid  M, \theta)\, \mathrm{d}\theta,
\end{align}
where $\Pr(\theta)$ is the hyperprior over parameter(-tuple) $\theta$
associated with model $M$ and $\Pr(D \mid M, \theta)$ is the
likelihood of the observed data $D$ given $M$ and each concrete
instantiation of the parameter(-tuple) $\theta$. The Bayes factor
$K^{M_1}_{M_2}$ is a comparative measure for the plausibility of model
$M_1$ over $M_2$, given their respective hyperpriors and the data in
question:
\begin{align}
  K^{M_1}_{M_2} = \frac{\mathrm{Ev}(M_1)}{\mathrm{Ev}(M_2)} \enspace .
\end{align}
Model $M_1$ makes the data more likely whenever $K^{M_1}_{M_2} > 1$, but
normally only a Bayes factor $K^{M_1}_{M_2} >3$ (or sometimes
$K^{M_1}_{M_2} > 5$) is considered substantial. Values $K^{M_1}_{M_2}
> 10$ are considered strong evidence.

In a sense, comparison by Bayes factors is comparing models in a wider
sense of the term: we actually compare pairs consisting of a model and
its associated hyperprior. For clarity, we refer henceforth to a
model-hyperprior pair as a Model.

\paragraph{Speaker data.} First we look at the speaker models $\sigma_{xy},\
x\in\{a,b\},y\in\{\mathcal{U},\mathcal{S}\}$. Each model has two
parameters $\lambda_\mathrm{S}$ and $c$. We assume that they are
independent of each other:
\begin{equation}\label{hyper-speaker-independent}
\Pr(\lambda_\mathrm{S},c)=\Pr(\lambda_\mathrm{S}) \cdot \Pr(c) \enspace .
\end{equation}
We are uncertain about the rationality of the speaker:
\begin{equation}\label{hyper-speaker-lambda}
\Pr(\lambda_\mathrm{S})= \mathcal{U}_{(0,11)}(\lambda_\mathrm{S}),
\end{equation}
which is a uniform distribution over $(0,11)$. Excluding
$\lambda$-values $\ge 11$ serves practical purposes only, but is
innocuous since the regions of non-negligible posterior likelihood of
$\lambda$ lie safely in the chosen interval for all models. Next, to
allow for the possibility of speaker preferences (nouns over
adjectives or vice versa), we consider two types of hyperpriors for
costs $c$. The first hyperprior has $\Pr(c)= \delta(c)$, the Dirac
delta distribution, that assigns all probability mass to $c=0$. This
captures the assumption that there is no speaker preference. The
second hyperprior is $\mathcal{U}_{(-0.4,0.4)}$, which captures the
notion that a preference exists, without commitment to either
direction. We restrict our attention to the interval $(-0.4,0.4)$,
because we consider higher levels of cost implausible, given that
utilities for successful communication live in $[0,1]$ and that we
believe that strive for communicative success should outrank
preference satisfaction in a rational model of communication. Taken
together, there are four speaker models, two hyperpriors for each, so
that we compare eight Models with respect to their evidences.

Evidences of speaker Models were calculated by grid approximation. The
results are shown as log-evidences in Table \ref{table:speaker
  mod}. (Notice that the Bayes factor between models is easily
compared by taking the differences between log-evidences.) We can see
that the data very strongly supports speaker models that do not take
the listener's perceptual salience into account. Also, it seems that
action-oriented models are slightly better than their belief-oriented
counterparts, even though the relevant Bayes factors are not
substantial by common standards. Finally, our data makes each speaker
Model that does allow for a speaker preference strongly more plausible
than its counterpart that does not. A look at the posterior likelihood
of $c$ for each speaker model informs us that our data supports the
belief in a speaker preference for nouns, see
Figure~\ref{fig:cost_post_s}.\footnote{\label{fn:truth-restriction-S}A
  technical aside: formally, action-based speaker models, as
  formulated in Section~\ref{sec:alternatives}, assign a non-zero
  probability to the event that a speaker chooses a description which
  is not true of the target object (unlike belief-based models). But
  since subjects in our experiments could only select between true
  alternatives, the predictions of action-based speaker models were
  restricted to truthful choices in the reported model comparison.}

In sum, our data supports the view that the speaker does not take into
account the preceptual salience of the listener, while having her own
preference for shape terms over color terms.


\paragraph{Listener data.} Each listener model has a speaker model
nested inside as a belief of the listener about the speaker's
behavior. Section \ref{sec:alternatives} introduced a total of 16
potentially relevant listener models, but we will focus on a selection
only. For one, we restrict our attention to those listener models that
are either entirely belief-based or entirely action-based. In other
words, we exclude as notionally inconsistent models like
$\rho_{\mathrm{a}\cdot}(\sigma_{\mathrm{b}\cdot})$ where the receiver
part assumes an action-based goal structure and the speaker part a
belief-based goal structure. For another, we assume that the
listener's model of the speaker is a reasonable one and therefore put
to the side listener models that embed speaker models that are highly
implausible, given the speaker data as discussed above. Effectively,
this discards listener models that include speaker models that take
the listener's salience prior into account. These two principled
restrictions leave us with four listener models to
compare.\footnote{Similar to the remarks about speaker models in
  Footnote~\ref{fn:truth-restriction-S}, we need to be mindful about
  the fact that action-based listener models assign non-zero
  probability to the choice of referents of which the given
  description is not true. Here, despite the fact that subjects in our
  experiments could in principle choose referents of which the given
  description is not true (this indeed happened once), we restricted
  the predictions of these models to only semantically compatible
  referent choices. We then discarded the one data point in which a
  subject choose a semantically non-compatible referent.}

Further variation comes from different relevant
hyperpriors. Belief-based models of the listener have the same
parameters as speaker models: the speaker's rationality
$\lambda_\mathrm{S}$ and the speaker's preference costs
$c$. Importantly though, hyperpriors over $\lambda_\mathrm{S}$ and
$c$, although formally parallel to those for speaker models, have a
different interpretation in listener models where they capture our
prior beliefs about the listeners' beliefs about the speakers' likely
rationality and preferences. This is true as well for action-based
models, which also have an additional parameter
$\lambda_\mathrm{L}$. Hyperpriors for the latter encode our prior
beliefs about the listener's actual rationality.

We consider a variety of hyperpriors that differ in whether they take
the speaker's costs into account, whether the listener's beliefs about
the speaker's rationality and preferences are uninformed (i.e., flat)
or informed (i.e., given by the posterior likelihood of parameters
given the actual speaker data) and, in action-based models, whether
the listener's level of rationality corresponds to his ``informed''
beliefs. The latter option effectively implements the assumption that
there is a tight correlation between the speaker's actual rationality,
the listener's actual rationality and the listener's beliefs about the
speaker's rationality.

Concretely, we consider the following ``flat'' hyperpriors:
\begin{align*}
  \Pr(\lambda_\mathrm{S},c) & =
  \mathcal{U}_{(0,11)}(\lambda_\mathrm{S}) \cdot
  \Pr(c) \\
  \Pr(\lambda_\mathrm{S},c,\lambda_\mathrm{L}) & = 
  \mathcal{U}_{(0,11)}(\lambda_\mathrm{S}) \cdot
    \Pr(c) \cdot  \mathcal{U}_{(0,11)}(
    \lambda_\mathrm{L}),
\end{align*}
for belief-based and action-based models respectively, where $\Pr(c)$
is the hyperprior for the speaker's preference parameter $c$. When
$\Pr(c) = \delta(c)$ we have a hyperprior that does not take costs
into account; otherwise we assume $\Pr(c) =
\mathcal{U}_{(-0.4,0.4)}(c)$, as before.

Hyperpriors that capture the idea that the listener's beliefs are good
guesses of speaker behavior are modeled as if informed by the data
from the speaker experiments:
\begin{align*}
  \Pr(\lambda_\mathrm{S},c) & = \Pr(\lambda_\mathrm{S},c \mid D_\mathrm{S}, M_\mathrm{S}) \\
  \Pr(\lambda_\mathrm{S},c,\lambda_\mathrm{L}) & = 
   \Pr(\lambda_\mathrm{S},c \mid D_\mathrm{S}, M_\mathrm{S}) \cdot  \mathcal{U}_{(0,11)}(
    \lambda_\mathrm{L}) \enspace .
\end{align*}
Here, $D_\mathrm{S}$ is the data from the speaker experiments, and
$M_\mathrm{S}$ the relevant speaker model. For a given listener model,
we consider only the embedded speaker model as relevant. We call
hyperpriors of the above form ``informed'' or, in the case of
action-based models, ``informed uncorrelated''. We distinguish the
latter from ``informed correlated'' hyperpriors of the form:
\begin{align*}
  \Pr(\lambda_\mathrm{S},c,\lambda_\mathrm{L}) & = 
   \Pr(\lambda_\mathrm{S},c \mid D_\mathrm{S}, M_\mathrm{S}) \cdot \Pr(\lambda_\mathrm{L} \mid D_\mathrm{S}, M_\mathrm{S}),
\end{align*}
where the listener's rationality parameter is distributed according to
the relevant posterior. All of the three types of informed hyperpriors
were tested in two varieties: whether the listener takes the sender's
preferences into account or not. If he does not, the posterior
$\Pr(\lambda_\mathrm{S},c \mid D_\mathrm{S}, M_\mathrm{S})$ is derived
from a speaker-hyperprior $\Pr(c) = \delta(c)$; otherwise from $\Pr(c)
= \mathcal{U}_{(-0.4,0.4)}(c)$.

Taken together, we consider two belief-based models, paired with four
hyperpriors, and two action-based models, paired with six hyperpriors
(see Table~\ref{table:listener mod}). Comparing these ten Models is
meant to address the following general questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is the goal structure assumed by participants in our task
  belief-based or action-based?
\item Does the listener take the estimated salience prior into account
  or not?
\item Is the listener's belief about the speaker's level of rationality
  ``correct'', i.e., in line with the observed speaker data?
\item Is the listener's level of rationality related to the speaker's
  actual level of rationality?
\end{enumerate}

Answers to these questions can be found by comparing the evidences of
the Models listed in Table~\ref{table:listener mod}.

The most striking contrast is that Models that do not take the
salience prior into account fare much worse than those that do. The
data makes a total rejection of Models that rely on uninformative
salience priors strongly plausible.

Another eye-catching feature is that there is a clear winner in the
list. The single best Model, which is substantially better than all
the others, is action-oriented and takes perceptual salience into
account. It has an informed-correlated hyperprior and assumes that the
listener does not take the speaker's preferences into account. This
result is highly thought-provoking, but should be taken with a grain
of salt. It might be that we merely got lucky by restricting the range
of $\lambda_\mathrm{S}$ and $\lambda_\mathrm{L}$ just to a small
region of reasonably high posterior likelihood for these
parameters. Further experimentation should tell us whether
informed-correlated hyperpriors are good predictors in general.

Most generally reliable are the results from flat hyperpriors. Here it
is interesting to note that all of the models that take salience
priors into account, with the exception of
$\rho_{\mathrm{b}\mathcal{U}}(\sigma_{\mathrm{b}\mathcal{S}})$ are
equally plausible, by common standards of Bayes factor
comparisons. This is despite the fact that action-based models have an
additional parameter.

Action-based models are also better at accommodating the idea that the
listener's estimate of the speaker behavior is roughly correct. The
belief-based models are substantially or strongly less plausible in
this case. In other words, action-based models, possibly due to the
added flexibility of another parameter, are better at explaining
production and comprehension data in unison.

This latter point is of interest with respect to the findings of
\cite{Frank} that a single parameter choice $\lambda=1$ provided a
good fit for both production and comprehension data. The RSA model
$\rho_{\mathrm{b}\mathcal{U}}(\sigma_{\mathrm{b}\mathcal{S}})$ with
fixed parameter $\lambda=1$ is a very poor predictor of our data. (We
focus here on comprehension, but the same applies to production data.)
Assuming $\lambda =1$ as the null hypothesis of a nested-model
comparison, we can use the Savage-Dickey method to compute a Bayes
factor
\cite{DickeyLientz1970:The-Weighted-Li,WagenmakersLodewyckx2010:Bayesian-hypoth}. Let
$\mathcal{M}$ be the parameterized Model with model
$\rho_{\mathrm{b}\mathcal{U}}(\sigma_{\mathrm{b}\mathcal{S}})$ and a
flat hyperprior, not taking costs into account. Given our data we
should adjust our beliefs in parameter value $\lambda=1$ by the Bayes
factor (computed approximately via MCMC sampling):
\begin{align*}
  K = \frac{P(\lambda=1 \mid D_\mathrm{L} \, , \, \mathcal{M})}{P(\lambda=1
    \mid \mathcal{M})} \approx \frac{1.25\text{e-9}}{8.18\text{e-2}} =
  1.52\text{e-8} 
\end{align*}
where $D_\mathrm{L}$ is the listener data. That means that our data
provides very strong evidence that the null hypothesis $\lambda=1$ is
incorrect.
